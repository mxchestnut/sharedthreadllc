# Community Guidelines

These guidelines ensure collaboration remains respectful, inclusive, and creative.

## Our Expectations

**We ask all contributors to:**

- **Respect identities, perspectives, and boundaries** — Honor the full humanity of every person
- **Critique work, not people** — Focus feedback on ideas and implementations
- **Contribute in good faith** — Assume positive intent and communicate clearly
- **Encourage curiosity over correctness** — Create space for learning and growth
- **Help foster a safe, collaborative environment** — Act as stewards of our shared space

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates these guidelines, please open an issue or contact us directly. We're committed to addressing concerns promptly and fairly.
