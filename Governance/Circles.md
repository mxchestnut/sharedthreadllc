Shared Thread’s advisory circles ensure accountability without hierarchy.

**Circles:**
- **Ethics & Transparency Circle** — oversees data, partnerships, and public reports.
- **Creator Experience Circle** — ensures accessibility, inclusivity, and user well-being.
- **Technical Stewardship Circle** — reviews tools, code ethics, and open-source compliance.

Circles meet quarterly and rotate members annually.
