# Growth Strategy

Our approach to sustainable, values-aligned growth that maintains our commitment to transparency and community care.

## Growth Philosophy

**Growth serves purpose, not the reverse.** We grow to increase our positive impact, not for growth's sake. Every expansion decision is evaluated against our core question: *Does this help us build systems that care for the people inside them?*

## Strategic Priorities

### Year 1: Foundation & Proof of Concept
- **Establish transparent operations** — Perfect our own transparency frameworks
- **Develop core services** — Consulting methodology and template systems
- **Build initial client base** — Work with 3-5 aligned organizations
- **Create educational content** — Share learnings and build thought leadership
- **Refine our model** — Iterate based on real-world implementation

### Year 2-3: Sustainable Expansion
- **Scale consulting services** — Serve 10-15 organizations annually
- **Develop WorkShelf platform** — Ethical productivity tools for broader use
- **Educational program launch** — Workshops and training on ethical technology
- **Template marketplace** — Help organizations implement our frameworks independently
- **Community building** — Foster network of transparency-focused organizations

### Year 3+: Ecosystem Development
- **Platform maturity** — WorkShelf as a sustainable revenue source
- **Industry influence** — Recognized voice in ethical technology and transparency
- **Partnership network** — Collaborations with aligned organizations and initiatives
