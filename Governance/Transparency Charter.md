Shared Threadâ€™s Transparency Charter defines how information flows between the company, community, and public.

**Commitments:**
- Public documentation of decisions, policies, and financial summaries.
- Accessible archives of historical versions.
- Clear rationale for changes or partnerships.

Transparency is proactive. Shared Thread designs systems that make its reasoning visible.
