# Doing Business As (DBA)

**Status:** No current DBAs

We don't currently operate under any "Doing Business As" names. Shared Thread, LLC is our primary legal and operational identity.

If we establish DBAs in the future, they will be documented here along with:
- Registration details
- Business purposes
- Geographic scope
- Renewal requirements

This transparency ensures stakeholders always know our complete legal structure.
