# Technology Strategy

Our approach to building and using technology that serves people and communities.

## Technology Philosophy

**Technology as a tool for human flourishing.** We believe technology should enhance human agency, protect privacy, and strengthen communities rather than extract value or create dependency.

## Core Technology Principles

### 1. Privacy by Design
- **Minimal data collection** - Only gather what's necessary for service delivery
- **User control** - People own and control their data
- **Transparent policies** - Clear communication about data use and protection
- **Secure systems** - Strong security protecting user privacy and trust

### 2. Accessibility First
- **Universal design** - Built for diverse abilities and circumstances
- **Progressive enhancement** - Core functionality works for everyone
- **User agency** - People can customize tools to meet their needs
- **Inclusive development** - Diverse perspectives in design and testing

### 3. Open Source Preferred
- **Community benefit** - Tools that can be adapted and improved by others
- **Transparency** - Code and processes open to inspection and contribution
- **Sustainability** - Avoiding vendor lock-in and proprietary dependencies
- **Collaboration** - Building with and for the broader developer community

### 4. Ethical Implementation
- **Human impact assessment** - Considering effects on users and communities
- **Bias mitigation** - Actively working against algorithmic and design bias
- **Sustainable practices** - Considering environmental impact of technology choices
- **Community input** - User and community involvement in technology decisions

## Technology Stack Philosophy

- **Incident response planning** for security issues or breaches
- **Transparent reporting** of security practices and any incidents

### Development Security
- **Secure coding practices** preventing common vulnerabilities
- **Dependency management** keeping libraries and tools updated
- **Code review processes** for security and quality assurance
- **Penetration testing** of systems before deployment

## Open Source Contributions

### Contribution Philosophy
We contribute to open source projects that:
- Align with our values around privacy, accessibility, and community benefit
- Support the broader ecosystem of ethical technology
- Enable other organizations to implement similar practices
- Strengthen the tools and frameworks we use

### Types of Contributions
- **Code contributions** to projects we use and benefit from
- **Documentation improvements** making tools more accessible
- **Accessibility enhancements** improving tools for diverse users
- **Community support** helping others use and contribute to projects

### Our Open Source Projects
- **Transparency templates** - Organizational frameworks for others to use
- **Accessibility tools** - Resources for building more inclusive technology
- **Privacy-first components** - Building blocks for ethical applications
- **Community resources** - Documentation and guides for ethical technology practices

## Technology Governance

### Decision-Making Process
1. **Values alignment assessment** - Does this technology support our principles?
2. **Community impact evaluation** - How does this affect users and communities?
3. **Privacy and security review** - Does this meet our protection standards?
4. **Accessibility assessment** - Is this usable by diverse people?
5. **Sustainability consideration** - Is this maintainable and ethical long-term?

### Regular Reviews
- **Quarterly technology audits** of tools and practices
- **Annual strategy reviews** with advisory circle input
- **Community feedback integration** on technology decisions
- **Market research** on emerging ethical technology options

### Adaptation & Evolution
- **Responsive changes** based on community needs and feedback
- **Proactive research** into new ethical technology options
- **Transparent communication** about technology decisions and changes
- **Learning documentation** to help other organizations make similar choices

## Measuring Technology Success

### Impact Metrics
- **User agency** - Do people have control over their technology experience?
- **Accessibility** - Can diverse users access and use our technology?
- **Privacy protection** - Are we effectively protecting user privacy?
- **Community benefit** - Does our technology strengthen communities?

### Technical Metrics
- **Security posture** - Are we maintaining strong security practices?
- **Performance** - Do our tools work efficiently and reliably?
- **Sustainability** - Are our technology choices environmentally responsible?
- **Maintainability** - Can we keep our systems running and improving?

### Community Feedback
- **User satisfaction** with our technology choices and implementations
- **Accessibility feedback** from users with diverse abilities
- **Privacy concerns** and suggestions from our community
- **Feature requests** and improvement suggestions

## Future Technology Directions

### Emerging Technologies
We monitor and evaluate new technologies for:
- **Ethical implementation potential** - Can this be used in ways that align with our values?
- **Community benefit** - Does this strengthen or harm communities?
- **Accessibility implications** - Will this create or remove barriers for people?
- **Privacy impact** - Does this enhance or compromise user privacy?

### Research & Development
- **Ethical AI applications** that enhance human agency rather than replace it
- **Decentralized systems** that distribute power rather than concentrate it
- **Community-owned infrastructure** that serves people rather than profits
- **Accessibility innovations** that expand access and inclusion

This technology strategy guides our tool selection, development practices, and client services while serving as a template for other organizations seeking to implement ethical technology practices.
