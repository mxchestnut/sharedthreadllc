# Financial Transparency Reports

All financial transparency at Shared Thread flows through two primary channels:

## Reporting Structure

- **Quarterly Weave Reports** — Include ratio-based summaries, funding sources, and operational updates
- **Annual Reflections** — High-level view of growth, lessons learned, and reinvestment strategies

## Our Approach

**Transparency is measured not by data volume but by clarity.** We focus on providing meaningful financial information that demonstrates our commitment to ethical operations and community benefit.

## What We Share

- Revenue allocation according to our stated ratios
- Major expenditures and investments
- Community and open source funding
- Growth and sustainability metrics

Reports are published in our [Weave Reports](../Community/WeaveReports/) section and archived for historical reference.
